# BRAIN-TUMOUR-CLASSIFICATION
Brain Tumor Classification with Grad-CAM Visualization  This project aims to classify brain tumors from MRI images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and visualize model attention with Grad-CAM. It provides an intuitive web interface for clinicians and users to understand both predictions and the underlying model focus areas.
